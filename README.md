# Project1-LetsGoV2

Project Description:
LetsGo is a community-based application that embraces groups with similar qualities and
 attributes, and allows users to create communities and events for members that align themselves
 with said qualities, attributes and interests. Events that are created within communities of the
 application aim to further integrate users with one another, embracing their shared ideals and
 interests. LetsGo focuses on inclusion of users rather than exclusion; if a user does not fit into a
 community, there will be others they can join, or they can create their own. Everyone has a place
 within the LetsGo application, and no user will be left alone.
